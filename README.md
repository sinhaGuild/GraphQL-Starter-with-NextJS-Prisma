#### APOLLO - NEXUS - GRAPHQL - TYPESCRIPT - PRISMA - SQLITE

## Nextjs Graphql Starter with nexus code-first approach

This example shows how to implement a **fullstack app in TypeScript with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) (frontend), [Nexus Schema](https://nxs.li/components/standalone/schema) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend). It uses a SQLite database file with some initial dummy data which you can find at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies

Download this example:

```
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-examples-latest/typescript/graphql-nextjs
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd graphql-nextjs
npm install
```

<details><summary><strong>Alternative:</strong> Clone the entire repo</summary>

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/graphql-nextjs
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.

### 2. Start the app

```
npm run dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

## Using the GraphQL API

You can also access the GraphQL API of the API server directly. It is running on the same host machine and port and can be accessed via the `/api` route (in this case that is [`localhost:3000/api`](http://localhost:3000/api)).

Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API.

### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a new user

```graphql
mutation {
  signupUser(name: "Sarah", email: "sarah@prisma.io") {
    id
  }
}
```

### Create a new draft

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
    content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
    authorEmail: "alice@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

### Publish an existing draft

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(postId: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  filterPosts(searchString: "graphql") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Retrieve a single post

```graphql
{
  post(postId: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

### Delete a post

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(postId: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.
